# Notable Design System

Welcome to the **Notable Design System** - a comprehensive collection of reusable components, design tokens, and
patterns that power the Notable note-taking application.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

Notable's design system is built around these core principles:

- **Clarity**: Clean, readable interfaces that help users focus on their content
- **Consistency**: Unified visual language across all features and platforms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components for everyone
- **Performance**: Lightweight, fast-loading components optimized for productivity
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable components that work across different contexts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The design system is organized into several key areas:

### Components

- **Button**: Primary interaction elements with multiple variants
- **Input**: Form controls for user input with validation states
- **Badge**: Status indicators and tags for organization
- **Card**: Content containers for notes, settings, and features
- **And more**: Modal, Dropdown, Tooltip, etc.

### Design Tokens

- **Colors**: Semantic color palette supporting light/dark themes
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, and hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale for layouts
- **Motion**: Animation curves and timing for smooth interactions

### Theme System

- **Light/Dark modes**: Complete theme switching capability
- **Custom themes**: Brand customization and user preferences
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements

## üöÄ Getting Started

All components are built with:

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling and theming
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Class Variance Authority** for component variants

## üìö Component Categories

### Core Components

Essential building blocks used throughout Notable:

- Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Badges
- Navigation, Layout, Typography

### Editor Components

Specialized components for the block editor:

- Block handles, Slash commands, AI toolbars
- Rich text formatting, Link previews

### Premium Features

Components for Notable's premium tier:

- AI assistant panels, Smart search
- Advanced export options, Analytics

## üé® Usage Guidelines

### Spacing

Use the spacing scale consistently:

- `gap-1` (4px) for tight spacing
- `gap-4` (16px) for standard spacing
- `gap-8` (32px) for section spacing

### Colors

Leverage semantic color tokens:

- `primary` for main actions
- `secondary` for supporting elements
- `destructive` for dangerous actions
- `muted` for backgrounds and disabled states

### Typography

Follow the type hierarchy:

- `text-3xl font-bold` for page titles
- `text-lg font-semibold` for section headers
- `text-sm text-muted-foreground` for metadata

## üîß Development
