# Notable Design System

Welcome to the Notable Design System documentation. This design system provides a comprehensive set of components,
design tokens, and guidelines for building consistent and beautiful user interfaces across the Notable application.

## Vision

The Notable Design System is built with the following principles in mind:

- **Minimalist**: Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Consistent**: Unified design language across platforms
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsive**: Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes

## Getting Started

The design system is organized into several key areas:

### 1. Design Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual
design attributes.

- **Colors**: Semantic color palette with support for light and dark themes
- **Typography**: Type scale and font families
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale
- **Effects**: Shadows, borders, and other visual effects
- **Motion**: Animation timing and easing functions

### 2. Components

Our component library includes:

- **Basic Components**: Button, Badge, Input, Textarea, etc.
- **Layout Components**: Card, Modal, etc.
- **Interactive Components**: Toggle, Slider, Dropdown, Tooltip
- **Complex Components**: Command Palette, Editor components

### 3. Themes

The design system supports multiple themes:

- **Light Theme**: Default theme optimized for daylight viewing
- **Dark Theme**: Eye-friendly theme for low-light environments
- **System Theme**: Automatically switches based on OS preference

## Usage

### Importing Components

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Badge } from '@notable/web/design-system/components'
```

### Using Design Tokens

```tsx
import { colors, spacing, typography } from '@notable/web/design-system/tokens'
```

### Theme Provider

Wrap your application with the ThemeProvider to enable theme switching:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@notable/web/design-system/theme'

function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider defaultTheme='system'>{/* Your app content */}</ThemeProvider>
}
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the design system:

1. Follow the existing patterns and conventions
2. Ensure components are accessible
3. Add stories for new components
4. Document props and usage examples
5. Test across different themes
