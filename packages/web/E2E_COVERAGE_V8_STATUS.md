# E2E Coverage V8 Implementation Status

## âœ… Successfully Implemented V8-based Coverage

### What's Working

- Removed babel-plugin-istanbul (was causing 40s+ build times)
- Implemented monocart-coverage-reports for V8-based coverage
- Coverage collection working with Playwright's native V8 coverage API
- Successfully generated coverage reports (HTML, LCOV formats)
- Achieved **33.92% line coverage** from a single test file

### Implementation Details

1. **Coverage Fixture** (`e2e/fixtures/coverage.ts`)
   - Uses Playwright's `page.coverage.startJSCoverage()` and `page.coverage.startCSSCoverage()`
   - Saves coverage data to `.nyc_output/v8-coverage/` directory
   - Includes globalTeardown function to aggregate and generate reports

2. **Test Updates**
   - All test files updated to import from `./fixtures/coverage` instead of `@playwright/test`
   - No babel instrumentation needed - much faster builds

3. **Coverage Report Generation**
   - Using monocart-coverage-reports to process V8 coverage data
   - Generates HTML, LCOV, and console reports
   - Filters out node_modules and .next directories

### Current Challenges

1. **Large Coverage Files**
   - Each coverage file is ~58MB (217,066 lines)
   - 171 files = ~10GB of coverage data
   - Processing times out when running all tests

2. **Test Execution**
   - Running all 541 tests takes too long
   - Many tests are failing due to missing test IDs or MSW mock issues
   - Need to fix tests and run in smaller batches

### Coverage Gaps (Based on 33.92% coverage)

Major uncovered areas:

- AI features (`components/ai/`)
- Editor plugins and advanced features
- Templates system
- Export functionality
- Tag management
- Search features
- Authentication flows
- Real-time sync

### Next Steps

1. **Optimize Coverage Collection**
   - Run tests in smaller batches
   - Consider filtering coverage data during collection
   - Implement incremental coverage aggregation

2. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Update MSW mocks to match expected behavior
   - Fix navigation issues in note creation tests
   - Handle missing database tables in test environment

3. **Increase Coverage to 100%**
   - Create E2E tests for all uncovered features
   - Focus on critical user paths first
   - Ensure all UI components have proper test coverage

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run E2E coverage
   - Set up Codecov with 100% requirement
   - Ensure coverage reports are uploaded correctly

### Commands

```bash
# Run single test with coverage
COVERAGE=1 pnpm playwright test e2e/simple-test.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Run all tests with coverage (currently times out)
pnpm e2e:coverage --reporter=list

# Generate coverage report from existing data
node generate-coverage.cjs
```

### Files Modified

- `e2e/fixtures/coverage.ts` - Complete rewrite for V8 coverage
- `playwright.config.ts` - Added globalTeardown
- `package.json` - Updated e2e:coverage scripts
- All test files - Updated imports to use coverage fixture
- Removed `babel.config.js` - No longer needed
