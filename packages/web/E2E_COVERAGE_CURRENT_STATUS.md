# E2E Coverage Implementation Current Status

## 📊 Current State (As of Commit)

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Test ID Implementation**
   - Added comprehensive test IDs to UI components:
     - Editor toolbar: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, code buttons
     - Headings: heading-1, heading-2, heading-3
     - Lists: bulleted-list, numbered-list
     - Other: quote-button, app-shell, new-note-button
   - Fixed test ID mismatches:
     - Changed `note-title` to `note-title-input`
     - Added `note-content-textarea` to Slate Editable
   - Added template test IDs:
     - template-picker, template-search, template-categories
     - template-category-{id}, template-card-{id}
     - template-variable-form

2. **Coverage Setup Attempts**
   - Initially tried babel-plugin-istanbul with babel.config.js
   - Removed babel config due to severe Next.js build performance issues
   - Implemented playwright-test-coverage package as alternative
   - Updated playwright config with longer timeouts (90s local, 120s CI)

3. **E2E Test Fixes**
   - Fixed import paths to use coverage fixture
   - Added longer navigation timeouts for initial compilation
   - Tests now run successfully (2/4 passed in note-creation.spec.ts)

### 🚧 Current Issues

1. **Coverage Collection Not Working**
   - playwright-test-coverage installed but not collecting coverage
   - NYC reports 0% coverage even after tests run
   - .nyc_output directory remains empty

2. **Test Failures**
   - note-creation.spec.ts: 2/4 tests failing
     - Expected URL change to `/notes/mock-note-\d+` not happening
     - Timeout when clicking New Note button multiple times
   - Compilation takes ~40s initially (auth: 38s, app: 20s)

3. **Missing Database Tables**
   - Supabase errors for missing tables:
     - saved_searches
     - search_history
     - note_tags relationship issue

### 📈 Coverage Progress

```
Current Coverage: 0% (collection not working)
Target Coverage: 100%
Test Files: 44 total E2E test files
```

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Fix Coverage Collection**
   - Debug why playwright-test-coverage isn't instrumenting code
   - Consider alternative: running tests against instrumented build
   - May need to use @playwright/test with custom fixture

2. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Update mock handlers to match expected behavior
   - Fix navigation after note creation
   - Handle missing database tables in test environment

3. **Complete E2E Coverage**
   - Run all 44 test files once coverage works
   - Identify coverage gaps
   - Create tests for uncovered features

### 🛠️ Technical Details

**Current Dependencies:**

- playwright-test-coverage: ^1.2.12
- @playwright/test: ^1.54.1
- nyc: ^17.2.0

**Configuration Files:**

- playwright.config.ts: Updated timeouts
- nyc.config.js: Configured for Next.js
- e2e/fixtures/coverage.ts: Using playwright-test-coverage

**Key Commands:**

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
COVERAGE=1 pnpm playwright test --reporter=list

# Generate coverage report
pnpm nyc report --reporter=text --reporter=lcov
```

### 🚨 Blockers

1. Coverage instrumentation not working with current setup
2. Initial compilation time causing timeouts
3. Database schema mismatches in test environment

### 📝 Recommendations

1. Consider using a pre-built dev server for tests to avoid compilation delays
2. May need to instrument code at build time instead of runtime
3. Set up proper test database schema or mock all Supabase calls
