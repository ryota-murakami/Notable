# Playwright Testing

When running Playwright tests, ensure you use the `--reporter=list` option to prevent launching the HTML reporter.

Example: `pnpm test -- --reporter=list`

After fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or changing styles:
1.  Use the `mcp` server to run Playwright and verify behavior.
2.  Automatically generate Playwright code that replicates your exact actions.
3.  For style changes, include screenshots to verify visual correctness.
