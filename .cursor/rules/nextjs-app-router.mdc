# Next.js App Router

This project uses the Next.js App Router.

- Use `'use server'` in files that must only run on the server.
- Use `'use client'` **only** at the top of the boundary component for the client-side tree.
- Do **not** reference the Next.js Pages Router.
- Data fetching should be done using Server Components where possible.
