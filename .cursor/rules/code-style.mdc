# Code Style & Standards

- Adhere strictly to the projectâ€™s Prettier configuration.
- **Only** fix TypeScript errors in code that is valid JavaScript and runs correctly at runtime. Never change runtime behavior during type fixes.
- For Next.js:
  - Use `'use server'` in files that must only run on the server.
  - Use `'use client'` **only** at the top of the boundary component for the client-side tree.
- Do **not** reference Next.js Pages Router.

## UI Task
- Before starting a local server, ensure port `3000` is available. If in use, a local instance is likely already running.
- After **fixing an app bug**, **implementing a feature**, or **changing styles**:
  1. Use the `mcp` server to run Playwright and verify behavior.
  2. Automatically generate Playwright code that replicates your exact actions.
  3. For style changes, include screenshots to verify visual correctness.
