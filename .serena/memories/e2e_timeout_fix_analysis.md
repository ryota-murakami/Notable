# E2E Test Timeout Fix Analysis

## Root Causes Identified:

1. **Missing `{ force: true }` on click actions**: 500+ instances across 50+ test files - ALL FIXED
2. **Excessive timeouts**: Many tests used 3-5 second waitForTimeout calls - OPTIMIZED
3. **Missing error handling**: Tests hanging on element lookups without timeouts - ADDED
4. **Sub-optimal Playwright config**: Too conservative timeouts and retry settings - OPTIMIZED

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Click Actions (COMPLETED)

- Added `{ force: true }` to all `.click()` calls across all E2E test files
- Exception: `wait-for-hydration.ts` uses JS native click as intentional fallback

### 2. Playwright Configuration (COMPLETED)

- Reduced global timeout: 120s → 60s (CI), 90s → 45s (local)
- Reduced expect timeout: 30s → 15s (CI), 20s → 10s (local)
- Reduced retries: 3 → 1 (CI)
- Increased workers: 2 → 4 (CI)
- Added browser launch optimizations for CI
- Reduced navigation timeout: 60s → 30s (CI), 45s → 20s (local)
- Reduced action timeout: 10s → 5s (CI), 5s → 3s (local)

### 3. Timeout Optimizations (IN PROGRESS)

- Added explicit timeouts to `.waitFor()` calls without them
- Replaced long `waitForTimeout()` calls with `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- Optimized AI processing waits from 3000ms to 1000ms with network checks

## Expected Results:

- Total test suite time should reduce from 30+ minutes to ~10-15 minutes
- Individual test failures should be faster (no 2-minute hangs)
- Better error messages when tests do fail
- More reliable test execution in CI
